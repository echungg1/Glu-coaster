            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This meal's impact on glucose levels shows how different nutritional compositions affect blood sugar. Understanding these patterns helps in making informed dietary choices.</p>
            <h3>Nutritional Balance is Complex</h3>
            <p>Our visualization highlights how various nutrients(carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber) interact with one another. Rather than focusing on each nutrient in isolation, it's essential to consider how they align collectively with recommended daily baselines. It is important to identify imbalances and gain a better understanding of nutritional intake.</p>
            <h3>Glucose Management is Time-Sensitive</h3>
            <p>The glucose line chart illustrates how blood sugar levels fluctuate over the course of a day. These changes are closely tied to the timing of meals, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner each producing distinct patterns in glucose response. Dotted vertical lines indicate mealtimes, helping users easily correlate glucose spikes or drops with specific eating events, thereby emphasizing the importance of when we eat, not just what we eat.</p>
            <h3>Health Implications are Long-term</h3>
            <p>Our key takeaway underscores that managing glucose levels is not only about short-term stability but also about preventing serious long-term health risks. Frequent spikes in blood sugar can gradually contribute to chronic conditions such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, poor glucose control may lead to complications affecting the kidneys, eyesight, and nerves which highlights the broader health consequences of sustained imbalances.</p>
